    "* It was developed by John von Neumann in 1945 and is known for its stable and predictable performance. \n",

    "#### Here are the main steps of the merge sort algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Divide:** Divide the unsorted list into two (or more) equal-sized sublists. This is typically done by finding the middle point of the list.\n",
    "* **Conquer:** Recursively sort each sublist. If a sublist has only one element, it is considered sorted by definition.\n",
    "* **Merge:** Merge the sorted sublists to produce a single sorted list. This is done by repeatedly comparing the smallest (or largest) element from each sublist and adding it to the final merged list until all elements are included.\n",
    "* Repeat steps 1-3 until the entire list is sorted.\n",

    "#### Fact:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Merge Sort has **linearithmic O(nlog n)** time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let's start by thinking about about 3 parts of **divide and conquer** and their running times.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 1. The divide step takes **constant time O(1)** since we already know the index where we are going divide at.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 2. The conquer step, where we recursively sort two subarrays of approximately n/2 elements.\n",
    "> 3. The combine step merges a total of n element talking **O(n)** time. <br>\n",
    "> \n",
    "\n",
    "* If we think about the **divide** and **combine** steps together, the divide take O(1) time and the combine takes O(n).\n",
    "* Taking the higher order term, we can think of both steps as taking **O(n)** time.\n",
    "* For simplicity purposes, assume that the divide and combine steps take **cn** time where c is a constant and that if **n > 1**, n is always even.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let's think of running the merge sort on an **n-element** subarray as being the sum of twice the running time of the mergesort on an **n/2-element** subarray.\n",
    "\n",
    "![complexity-1](./images/mergesort-complexity-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* As the subproblems get smaller, the number of subproblems doubles at each \"level\" of the recursion, but the merging time halves.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The doubling and halving cancel each other out, and so the total merging time is **cn** at each level of recursion.\n",
    "* Eventually, we get down to subproblems of size 1: the **base case**, we spend **Î˜(1)** time to sort subarrays of size 1\n",
    "* Now the **total running time** is equal to the total time of taken in each level.\n",
    "* If there are ***l*** levels in the tree, then the total merging time is ***l.cn***\n",
    "* In our example, ***l*** = 4 when **n** = 8, therefore **l = log(n) + 1**.\n",
    "* **cn(log(n) + 1)** = **cnlog(n) + cn**.\n",
    "* Drop the lower order term **cn**, we are left with **cnlog(n)**.\n",
    "* Drop the constant, **c** were are left with **nlog(n)**.\n",
    "* Therefore, the time complexity of **merge sort** algorithm is **O(nlog n)**.\n"
